How to capture image of a VM in Azure Portal?
During the process of capturing the image the server is stopped. After creating the image we need to start the image again.
A virtual machine > select the vm whos images to be capturedSelect capture > 
To find the image: Services > Images 
To create server using the created image: Select image and tap on create VM

How to Attach extra disk to VM in Azure?
Select vm > Left side disk> add data disk > LUN (no. of disks to be created)> In NAME we can select either available disk orelse create a new disk. > TAp on create. and Then save.
In a subnet 5 ips are not useable the are saved for passive use.
1 for network
2 for default gateway
3,4 for DNS
5 for broadcast

Subnet is something that breaks the network in small part

NIC IN Azure acts as Internet gateway IN AWS

How to create Azure Virtual Network?
All Services > Virtual Network > Add/Create virtual network > Name(Name of your vitual network) > Address space (the VPC cidr block) > Subscrition > Resource group (Create a new) > Location >
In Subnet > Name > Address range (The cidr block for subnet) > Ddos Protection basic > Service endpoint disabled > firewall disabled > Then create. 

How to established a connection between two VM ?
All Services : Virtual machine> Create virtual machine > Resource group > vnet-rg (created) > name > region (Where you have created the virtual network)> availability optons (no)>
credentials (Windows) > port > IN NETWORKING > Virtual Network (The one we created VPC ) > Subnet > Review+create > create.
Create one more vm for same config
Try to ping from one vm to another vm it will not work bcoz the windows blocks ICMP port. 
In windows just turn off windows firewall on boith vms 

Vnet to Vnet Peering in same region.
Create two virtual network > create two virtual machine > Select the VN > Peering > Add > Name > In virtual network select the VN where we want to peer the connection > Ok.
Do the same with Other VN.
Refresh peering it gets connected.
Still we cannot ping to the VM on other VN (Windows) : Turn off windows firewall.   

Vnet to Vnet Peering in different region
First we need to create the VN in the required region.
Then we need to create Virtual network gateway :
All Services > Virtual network gateway > Create virtual network gateway > Name > Gateway type (VPN)> VPN type (Route-based) > SKU (default) > choose virtual network (If you dont find 
your location then scroll down and in Location give your reqyuired location)> Public ip Address (Guve name) > CREATE.
Create the virtual network gateway for other virtual network.

launch the vm in two different virtual network. 
Go to Virtual Network gateway > Add > Name > Connection type (Vnet to vnet) > First virtual network gateway (From where we need to
Establish the network) > 2ND virtual network gateway (to where we need to Establish the network) > Shared key (Just a word which should be same in both region gateway) > OK.
Do the same with other virtual network gateway> First virtual network gateway (From where we need to Establish the network) > 2ND virtual network gateway (to where we need to 
Establish the network) > Shared key will be same as previous network gateway > OK


Azure Load Balancer : 
Load balancer uses a hash-based algorithm which means it check Source ip, source port, Destination ip, Destination Port, IP protocol. For distribution of inbound flows. 
Create Virtual 2 machine> During creation > availability set Select availability set > Create new availability set > Name (Load balance set) > OK .
For 2nd server Give same availability set 
All service > Load Balancer > Create Load balancer > Name > Type (public)> SKU (basic) > Public ip Address (Create New) > Dynamic > Resource grp > Location should be where the 
vm is located > Create.
Open LoadBalancer > Backend pool > Add > Name (BAckend) > Associated (availability set) > Select the availability set created for load balancer > add a Target network ip configuration
Target virtual machine (Select the Webserver) > Select the ip > For webserver 2 again (add a Target network ip configuration) > Target virtual machine (Select the Webserver) > 
Select the ip > OK

Health Probes : 
ADD> Name > Protocol (http=bcoz we need to create it using Internet) > OK

LOAD BALANCING RULES:
Add > Name > IP Version (IPv4) > Frontend IP Address (LoadbalancerFrontend) > Protocol (TCP) > Port (80) > Backend Pool (backend no. of machine) > Health probe (health HTTP:80)
Session peristence (None) > Idle timeout (Before idle timeout it will not send the request to other server default it is 4 min) > Floating ip (disabled) > OK   

INTERNAL LOAD BALANCER : 
Place both in same subnet 
Create Virtual network: 
Create Vurtual machine :availability option (availability set) > availability set create new >  Managemnt > Boot diagonostic (off).
LOAD BALANCER : 
Create load balancer > Name > type (INTERNAL) > SKU(Basic till 1000 Instance) > Virtual network (In whivh the webserver are present) > Subnet (Same in which the webserver are present)
IP address (Dynamic) > Resource group > location (VM location) > ok.
Open LoadBalancer > Backend pool > Add > Name > Associated (availability set) > Select the availability set created for load balancer > add a Target network ip configuration
Target virtual machine (Select the Webserver) > Select the ip > For webserver 2 again (add a Target network ip configuration) > Target virtual machine (Select the Webserver) > 
Select the ip > (You dont need to add the 3rd server here) OK 

Health Probes : 
ADD> Name > Protocol (http) > OK

LOAD BALANCING RULES:
Add > Name > IP Version (IPv4) > Frontend IP Address (LoadbalancerFrontend) > Protocol (TCP) > Port (80) > Backend Pool (backend no. of machine) > Health probe (health HTTP:80)
Session peristence (None) > Idle timeout (Before idle timeout it will not send the request to other server default it is 4 min) > Floating ip (disabled) > OK
